      content: '<p>About half of this course hinges around a general understanding
        of probability theory and some essential statistical tools such as MLEs and
        Confidence Intervals.

        Although most of the materials in this course are self-contained and usually
        do a retouch on these fundamental concepts, it is highly suggested that students
        who take this course, already have a strong background in both probability
        and statistics.</p>

        <p>There are a number of excellent courses available online covering these
        topics. A skim through the material or lectures of such courses might be a
        perfect way to review and fill in the gaps of your probabilistic and statistical
        sense!</p>

        <p>The following two courses from <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OCW</a>,
        are a great start:</p>'

        description: <p>A thorough course that covers probability theory from axioms
          up until basic Markov Chains and Markov Decision Processes. Instructed by
          the great Prof. John Tsitsiklis, auditing this course is highly suggested
          for those students who feel uncomfortable with general probability theory.</p>
