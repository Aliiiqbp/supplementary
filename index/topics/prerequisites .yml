      About half of this course hinges around a general understanding of probability theory and some essential statistical tools such as MLEs and Confidence Intervals.
      Although most of the materials in this course are self-contained and usually do a retouch on these fundamental concepts, it is highly suggested that students who take this course, already have a strong background in both probability and statistics.

      There are a number of excellent courses available online covering these topics. A skim through the material or lectures of such courses might be a perfect way to review and fill in the gaps of your probabilistic and statistical sense!

      The following two courses from [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/), are a great start:

        A great course which covers probability theory from axioms up until basic Markov Chains and Markov Decision Processes. Intructed by the great
